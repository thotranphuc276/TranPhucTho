## **Project Structure**
```
/src
  |-- /controllers        # Controllers for resource logic
  |-- /models             # Sequelize models
  |-- /routes             # Routes for CRUD operations
  |-- /config             # Database configuration
  |-- index.ts            # Entry point
/README.md                # Instructions to configure and run
/tsconfig.json            # TypeScript configuration
/package.json             # Dependencies
```

## Requirements
- Node.js (v14+)
- npm (v6+)

## Installation
